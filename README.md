This repository contains code for analysing data on chlamydia infection, testing and diagnosis from the Natsa-l3 study: http://www.natsal.ac.uk/natsal-3.aspx The data is available from the UK Data Archive: http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8178-1

The code is organised in the following files:

* `reason_setting.R` is used to examine reason for test, test setting, number of new partners in the last year, and correlations between them.
* `positivity_risk_newpart.R` compares positivity of tests carried out for different reasons, and by men and women reporting different numbers of partners.
